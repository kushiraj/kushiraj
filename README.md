## 🌟 Hi, I’m Kanchu Kushi Raj!
On my journey to become a Software Engineer, blending AI/ML, cloud computing, and web development to craft impactful solutions. 💻



## 👩‍💻 ABOUT ME
💡 Driven by a passion for AI, ML, and optimization techniques, I focus on solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions. With expertise in AI/ML and Cloud technologies (Azure & AWS), I enjoy creating intelligent, scalable applications that blend innovation, functionality, and impact.

🎓 As a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at SR University, I have built a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey includes internships at NIT Warangal and Skill Vertex, where I gained hands-on experience in applying advanced concepts to practical challenges.

💻 My technical experience spans across graph theory, NLP, and full-stack development, along with leveraging cloud-native tools to deploy and scale applications. I’ve also worked on impactful projects such as spam detection, hotel management systems, and book recommendation engines, showcasing my ability to apply theory to real-world domains.

🌐 As the Chairperson of the Cloud Computing and DevOps Club at SRU, I lead cloud-native initiatives, organize workshops, and mentor peers in emerging technologies. I strongly believe in knowledge sharing, collaboration, and building technology that not only solves problems but also strengthens communities.

## 💼 PROJECTS

[ Spam SMS Detection](https://github.com/kushiraj/spam-mail-detection-using-dl)

Built an NLP-based classifier to detect spam messages using deep learning techniques like BERT and LSTM. Designed a preprocessing pipeline for tokenization and semantic feature extraction. The model effectively distinguishes spam from ham and is hosted in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python and NLP libraries.

[ Hotel Management System](https://github.com/kushiraj/Hotel_Management_System_Using_DBMS)

Developed a DBMS-based hotel management system using MySQL and Python to handle bookings, customer records, billing, and check-ins. Implemented relational schemas and SQL queries for real-time data management. This system streamlines hotel operations through an interactive interface and backend integration.

[ Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/kushiraj/Book-Recommendations)

Designed a content-based recommendation system that suggests books using user preferences and past behavior. Built an intuitive UI with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and implemented recommendation logic on the backend. Enhanced reading experience through personalized suggestions and smooth navigation.

[ TRD3 Optimization – NIT Warangal](https://github.com/kushiraj/nit_research)

Worked on Total Roman Domination 3 problem using Differential Evolution algorithm to minimize weight functions on graph structures. Conducted research on heuristic modeling, mutation strategies, and fitness evaluation in Python. Results visualized using NetworkX and NumPy for mid-sized graphs.

[ CLOUD CLUB LEADERSHIP]

Founded and currently lead the Cloud Computing and DevOps Club at SRU. Organized workshops on Azure, GitHub Actions, Docker, and serverless apps. Mentored 200+ students and led collaborative projects on cloud-native applications and infrastructure automation.
