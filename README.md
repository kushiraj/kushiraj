## Hi there, My name is Kushi Raj Kanchu! üëã

## About Me  
I am a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, currently in my third year at SR University. With a strong foundation in programming and cloud technologies, I build impactful software solutions using modern tools and frameworks. My experience includes web development, AI/ML projects, and cloud-native applications, with hands-on work in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Azure.

As a proactive learner and problem solver, I enjoy working in collaborative environments and tackling real-world challenges. I lead the Cloud Computing and DevOps Club at SRU and continuously explore innovations in cloud, AI, and automation.

## Projects

### Spam SMS Detection  
Built an NLP-based classifier to detect spam messages using deep learning techniques like BERT and LSTM. Designed a preprocessing pipeline for tokenization and semantic feature extraction. The model effectively distinguishes spam from ham and is hosted in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python and NLP libraries.

### Hotel Management System  
Developed a DBMS-based hotel management system using MySQL and Python to handle bookings, customer records, billing, and check-ins. Implemented relational schemas and SQL queries for real-time data management. This system streamlines hotel operations through an interactive interface and backend integration.

### Book Recommendation System  
Designed a content-based recommendation system that suggests books using user preferences and past behavior. Built an intuitive UI with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and implemented recommendation logic on the backend. Enhanced reading experience through personalized suggestions and smooth navigation.

### TRD3 Optimization ‚Äì NIT Warangal  
Worked on Total Roman Domination 3 problem using Differential Evolution algorithm to minimize weight functions on graph structures. Conducted research on heuristic modeling, mutation strategies, and fitness evaluation in Python. Results visualized using NetworkX and NumPy for mid-sized graphs.

### ML Internship ‚Äì Skill Vertex  
Completed a project-based AI internship where you applied machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Participated in live sessions and teamwork-based tasks to develop critical thinking and hands-on AI experience, including work on generative AI models.

### Cloud Club Leadership  
Founded and currently lead the Cloud Computing and DevOps Club at SRU. Organized workshops on Azure, GitHub Actions, Docker, and serverless apps. Mentored 200+ students and led collaborative projects on cloud-native applications and infrastructure automation.
